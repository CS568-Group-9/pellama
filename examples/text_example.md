In the heart of Middle Earth, Isengard stood as a fortress of formidable strength, its towering walls a testament to the power of Saruman the White. Yet, on this ominous day, even its impregnability seemed to falter against the foreboding crimson hue that tainted the sky. The once serene heavens now mirrored the turmoil spreading from the distant lands of Mordor, where the shadow of Sauron loomed large. As the red sky cast its eerie glow upon Isengard, the fortress seemed to hold its breath, feeling the weight of impending doom. Amidst the chaos, the echoing cries of war and the relentless march of darkness reminded all within its walls that the fate of Middle Earth hung precariously in the balance.
