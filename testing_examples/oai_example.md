This was no ordinary sunset but the dreadful aftermath of Mordor's relentless onslaught. Saruman could do nothing but watch from the towering heights of Orthanc, as the menacing, blood-red hue stretching from East to West signaled the rise of Sauronâ€™s tyranny. The once-tranquil skies had turned into a tormented canvas, reflecting the fury of the Dark Lord, thus filling inhabitants with a dread that ran as deep as the roots of the ancient trees.

To create a version of the image that addresses your preferences, you might consider specifying the absence of swirling clouds and requesting smoother mountain features to soften the overall appearance of the landscape. Here is a suggested prompt for DALL-E 3 that might help achieve the look you're aiming for:

"Fantasy landscape inspired by Middle Earth's Isengard during the Mordor invasion, featuring a dramatic but smooth red sky and gently rolling mountains without sharp peaks, surrounded by lush forests and a serene river flowing through the valley, under a soothing, diffuse light."

This prompt aims to adjust the elements of the scene to a more tranquil and less intense visual style while maintaining the fantastical and epic essence of the original setting.

Middle Earthâ€™s Isengard with a dynamic, deep red sky inspired by Mordorâ€™s invasion, featuring high-contrast lighting. Include sharp, clearly defined rock formations with realistic textures contrasted against deep, vibrant green trees. The river should appear crystal clear with distinct reflections of the sky, surrounded by a lively, detailed landscape with subtle hints of wildlife and natural elements to enhance realism.
