A tall black rectangular building to the left of a river in a city; cars cross on a bridge in front of the building. The sky is hazy and striated gray clouds. There are a number of adjacent buildings of varying colors: several are light gray concrete with blue windows, and one, closest to the viewer, is made of large granite blocks in alternating rows of red and gray.

A tall black rectangular building to the left of a river in a city; cars cross on a bridge in front of the building. The road with cars runs directly across the image. The sky is hazy and softly wrinkled gray clouds. There are a number of adjacent buildings of varying colors: several are light gray concrete with blue windows, and one, closest to the viewer, is made of large granite blocks in alternating rows of red and gray. A tug boat is docked on the left bank of the river next to the black building. No boats are moving on the river. There are only one or two pedestrians.

prompt

We should see the main large building from straight on, and the rive should run directly away from the viewer. The sky is excessively textured: the actual phenomenon is more of a smoothly changing color field than a brain coral.

          The prompt to generate the image below was: "A tall black rectangular building to the left of a river in a city; cars cross on a bridge in front of the building. The sky is hazy and striated gray clouds. There are a number of adjacent buildings of varying colors: several are light gray concrete with blue windows, and one, closest to the viewer, is made of large granite blocks in alternating rows of red and gray." 

response

To enhance the image based on your feedback and focusing on alignment and sky texture, you could refine the DALLE-3 prompt as follows:

"A dramatic view of a large, imposing black skyscraper positioned centrally, viewed head-on across a straight river channel flowing directly into the foreground. The skyscraper flanks a bustling city scene with a bridge crowded with cars crossing the river. Adjacent to the skyscraper, include a variety of buildings in a harmonious blend, emphasizing modern architecture with large windows reflecting the sky. Replace the sky with a softly gradient, misty blue sky, gradually transitioning from light near the horizon to a deeper blue overhead, devoid of heavy texturing to ensure a calm, serene backdrop."

This revised prompt specifies the perspective and clarifies the desired texture of the sky, aiming to create a more visually appealing and balanced image.

Multi-colored corgi puppy sitting on a single dark forest green in a living room setting. There should be a tv mounted on a red brick wall over a lit natural fire place with burning logs across from the chair. I want the chair to be facing the tv with a dark brown coffee table in between the chair and tv.

prompt

I like the corgi design and the chair color. I like the brick wall layout with the tv and fire place. The main issue is that I want the couch to be facing the tv with a coffee table in between.

response

To adjust the image to align with your preference for the couch, TV, and coffee table arrangement, you could modify the DALL-E 3 prompt to specifically include those requirements. Here's an improved prompt that incorporates your feedback about the layout and viewing direction:

"A cozy living room with a cream-colored l-shaped couch facing a large tv mounted on a red brick wall above a natural wood-burning fireplace. A multi-colored corgi puppy sitting on a dark forest green armchair to the side. A rustic wooden coffee table is placed centrally between the couch and the TV, with soft lighting and candles on the mantle, creating a warm, inviting atmosphere."

This prompt should help generate an image that better matches your desired room layout and furniture orientation.
